            <p>I'm a sophomore at Duke Univeristy
                studying computer science and economics. 
                I'm from Los Angeles and enjoy cycling,
                running, and trying unique foods. My other interests
                include foreign policy and architecture. On campus, I am 
                involved in Club Running, Club Cycling, and Soceity of Hispanic Professional Engineers.

            <h4>Bass Connections: Early Earthquake Warning System</h4>
            <p>This Duke Bass Connections project is developing an early eathquake warning system to
                be deployed in Nepal using microcontrollers, Internet of Things platforms, and 
                trained detection algorithms. Aspects of technology, hazard analysis, and 
                policy intersect to create this interdisciplinary team.

            <h4>Data+ : Tracking Building Congestion Using WiFi Data</h4>
            <p>In light of Dukeâ€™s reopening amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to track
                the movement of foot traffic in and around Bryan Center by analyzing Wifi log data 
                from all users connected to wireless networks in the center during February 2020. Our team 
                employed Markov Chains, Kernel Density Estimations, and data analysis and visualization 
                tools such as Python and Tableau to create a map of Wifi access points in Bryan Center and
                a heatmap that visualizes congestion.
